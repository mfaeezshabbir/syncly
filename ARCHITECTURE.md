# Syncly Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture for **Syncly**, an AI-powered, visual workflow builder. It outlines the system‚Äôs key components, high-level design decisions, and how different modules interact.

---

## üèõÔ∏è High-Level Overview

Syncly is a web-based platform for designing, configuring, and executing automation workflows via a drag-and-drop interface. It leverages modern frontend frameworks, a scalable backend, and AI services for smart suggestions and automation.

**Key Goals:**
- Intuitive, visual workflow creation and editing.
- Extensible support for automation steps and integrations.
- AI-powered template and configuration assistance.
- Real-time collaboration and workflow execution.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Main Components

### 1. **Frontend**

- **Framework:** Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, custom CSS modules
- **State Management:** React Context API and/or Redux
- **Drag-and-Drop:** React Flow or custom implementation
- **AI Integration:** Interfacing with Gemini/Genkit for suggestions

**Responsibilities:**
- Render the drag-and-drop workflow canvas.
- Allow users to add/configure steps, connect nodes, and manage workflow logic (branching, loops, triggers).
- Provide UI for template suggestions, workflow logs, and real-time feedback.
- Interact with backend APIs for persistence, execution, and AI features.

---

### 2. **Backend**

- **Language:** Node.js (TypeScript)
- **Framework:** Express.js or Next.js API routes (for smaller deployments)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for workflow storage and metadata)
- **Authentication:** JWT/OAuth (integrated with NextAuth.js for frontend)
- **AI Service Integration:** Secure API calls to Gemini/Genkit

**Responsibilities:**
- Persist workflows as structured JSON (nodes, links, step config, metadata).
- Manage user accounts, authentication, and access control.
- Handle workflow execution requests and orchestrate step logic.
- Interface with AI APIs for template suggestion and smart configuration.
- Provide RESTful or GraphQL APIs for all frontend interactions.

---

### 3. **Automation Engine**

- **Role:** Executes workflows, handles step orchestration, error handling, and state.
- **Features:**
  - Runs each step in sequence or parallel as defined.
  - Supports conditional logic, loops, retries, and error fallback.
  - Handles external integrations (APIs, webhooks, notifications, etc.).
  - Provides real-time execution updates to frontend via WebSocket or polling.

---

### 4. **AI Integration**

- **Services:** Gemini, Genkit (or other LLM APIs)
- **Use Cases:**
  - Suggest workflow templates based on user role or description.
  - Auto-complete or recommend step configurations.
  - Detect logic errors or inefficiencies in workflow design.
  - (Future) Natural language workflow creation.

---

### 5. **Collaboration Features**

- **Real-time Collaboration:**  
  Using WebSockets (Socket.io or similar) to sync workflow edits, comments, and status between users.
- **Versioning:**  
  Store workflow versions and allow rollback/restore.

---

## üîó Data Flow

1. **User opens Syncly UI in browser.**
2. **Frontend fetches existing workflows** or offers AI-suggested templates.
3. **User designs workflow** via drag-and-drop and step configuration.
4. **Frontend saves workflow** to backend (as JSON) via API.
5. **User runs workflow:**  
   - Frontend sends execution request to backend.
   - Backend‚Äôs automation engine processes steps and integrations.
   - Real-time progress is sent back to frontend.
6. **AI features:**  
   - Frontend or backend sends context to AI service for template/config suggestions.
   - Results displayed in UI.
